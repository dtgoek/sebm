# High-resolution debris cover mapping using UAV-derived thermal imagery

The model uses high resolution land surface temperature maps (LST) to solve a surface energy balance model (SEBM) for spatially distributed debris thicknesses at various times of a day. The diurnal variability allows for consideration of the rate of change of heat storage.
The model follows the principle that all energy fluxes (W/m-2) at the earth surface must sum to zero:

S + L(LST) + H(LST) + dS(LST, d) + G(LST, d) = 0

S = net shortwave radiation
L = net longwave radiation
H = sensible heat fluxes
dS = rate of change of heat storage
G = ground heat flux
LST = land surface temperature
d = debris thickness

DATA INPUT
1) LST maps
2) DEM
3) Meteorological data (air temperature, wind speed and relative humidity)
4) Other parameters

RUN THE MODEL

To run the model and produce debris thickness maps run both notebooks in following order

1) __01_warming_rate.ipynb__

warming_rate.ipynb is a wrapper for the functions stored in the file sinosoidal_regression.py. It performs a least squares regression of a sine function to describe the diurnal temperature variation within a layer of debris, assuming that the mean debris temperature equals the arithmetic mean of the LST and the assumed debris ice interface temperature of 0Â°C. The warming/cooling rate is then generated by first derivative with respect to time. The notebook wrapper creates a warmingrate folder in the directory containing the warming/cooling rate maps as geotiff files for each time.

2) __02_SEBM_debristhickness.ipynb__

Once the warming/cooling rate maps have been created, run SEBM_debristhickness.ipynb. The notebook is a wrapper for the functions stored in energy_balance_model.py. It calculates the individual energy balance components and solves a quadratic equation for debris thickness in each pixel. Resulting maps are saved as geotiff files.
