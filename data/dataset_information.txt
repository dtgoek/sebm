Containing Datasets:

ERA5_Land_aoi.csv
Interpolated from ERA5 Land hourly data on 30.08.2019, 7am - 11pm (UTM timezone) at Tsijiore-Nueve Glacier (TNG), Switzerland (46.01, 7.46)

Muñoz Sabater, J. (2019). ERA5-Land hourly data from 1981 to present. Climate Data Store.

Land Surface Temperature (LST):
LST map as *.geotiff files at various times of the day. Orthomosaic maps have been produced using Agisoft Metashape Professional 1.6.4.
Overlapping radiometric thermal image data was corrected and calibrated in a previous processing step.
Radiometric image data was collection using a FLIR Tau2 sensor mounted to a DJI Mavic Pro.

20190830_debristhickness_TNG.csv
Debris thickness measurements collected during field work on TNG. Measurements were done by Leif Anderson.

CastShadowSurroundingTerrain
Correction for cast shadows from the surrounding topography was done separately a DEM of larger extent. The shadows were calculated using the functions in energy_balance_model.py
The resulting cast shadow maps here were resampled and clipped to match the spatial resolution of the LST data.

20190830_DEM.tif
DEM generated by structure-from-motion technique using optical image data processed in Agisoft Metashape Professional 1.6.4. Optical image data has been collected
simultaneously with the thermal data on 30.08.2019 using a DJI Mavic Pro 12MP camera.

classTIR_19.tif
Supervised classification of the thermal orthomosaic at 15h using a random forest algorithm. The image segmentation required manually select training data of:
  1) bare ice surfaces
  2) debris cover

The classification map is used to assign emissivity and albedo values to the debris or ice surfaces during the processing.
